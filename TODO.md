# To-Do List

Possible categories:
* Dashboard (Has a scrolling news feed like IMC News, homework, timetables, news, an RM unify link and more.)
* Norwich School Maps
* Timetable
* Homework
* News
* Tests of Life
* Settings
* Feedback
* Chat
* Sport

Ideas:
* Chat - it would connect to Outlook and use the email format, but in a text message-style environment, so it's not a trauma to ask about homework and catching up on homework. Groups can be created, so clubs can talk about meeting points and sports teams can discuss what to do.
* Dashboard - scrolling news feed, homework to do, next lessons and tomorrow's lessons at night, news and RM Unify links.

Other Info:
* OneSignal notifications (we can make a Thunkable workaround by opening a web browser with the OneSignal signup page.)
* News posting and beta signup recieveing with Firebase.
